    "Outliers can significantly impact measures of central tendency and dispersion, often skewing the values and leading to a misrepresentation of the data. Let's explore how outliers affect these statistical measures with an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Measures of Central Tendency:**\n",
    "1. **Mean (Average):** Outliers have a substantial impact on the mean because they pull the average towards extreme values. A single extremely high or low value can distort the mean, making it less representative of the majority of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "   *Example:* Consider the dataset: \\[1, 2, 3, 4, 100\\]\n",
    "   - Without the outlier (100), the mean is \\( \\frac{1+2+3+4}{4} = 2.5 \\).\n",
    "   - With the outlier, the mean becomes \\( \\frac{1+2+3+4+100}{5} = 22 \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Median (Middle Value):** The median is less sensitive to outliers than the mean because it is not influenced by extreme values. However, if the dataset contains a significant number of outliers, the median may still be affected.\n",
    "\n",
    "   *Example:* Using the same dataset, the median remains \\(3\\) with or without the outlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Mode (Most Frequent Value):** Outliers usually don't affect the mode since it is based on the frequency of values. However, in some cases, a dataset with a single extreme outlier might have a unique mode at the outlier's value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Measures of Dispersion:**\n",
    "1. **Range:** Outliers can significantly impact the range, which is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset. A single outlier can lead to an overestimation of the spread of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "   *Example:* With the dataset \\[1, 2, 3, 4, 100\\], the range is \\(100 - 1 = 99\\) due to the outlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Interquartile Range (IQR):** The IQR, which measures the spread of the middle 50% of the data, is less sensitive to outliers than the range. Outliers can affect the extremes of the dataset but have a limited impact on the IQR.\n",
    "\n",
    "   *Example:* For the dataset \\[1, 2, 3, 4, 100\\], the IQR is \\(Q3 - Q1 = 4 - 2 = 2\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Standard Deviation:** Outliers can significantly impact the standard deviation because it considers the deviation of each data point from the mean. A single outlier can increase the standard deviation, indicating higher variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "   *Example:* For the dataset \\[1, 2, 3, 4, 100\\], the standard deviation is higher with the outlier, reflecting increased variability.\n",
