This could lead to misleading interpretations and conclusions about the product's perceived ease of use."

    "Measures of central tendency and variability are essential in statistics to summarize and describe datasets. They provide insights into the typical or central value of the data and the spread or variability around that central value. Here are some common measures of central tendency and variability:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Measures of Central Tendency:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mean (Average):**\n",
    "   - **Description:** The mean is calculated by summing up all the values in a dataset and dividing by the number of observations.\n",
    "   - **Use:** It provides a measure of the central location of the data. The mean is sensitive to extreme values (outliers) and is appropriate for normally distributed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Median:**\n",
    "   - **Description:** The median is the middle value in a sorted dataset. If there is an even number of observations, the median is the average of the two middle values.\n",
    "   - **Use:** It is less sensitive to outliers than the mean and is suitable for skewed or non-normally distributed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Mode:**\n",
    "   - **Description:** The mode is the most frequently occurring value in a dataset.\n",
    "   - **Use:** It is useful for categorical data or discrete distributions. A dataset may have one mode (unimodal), more than one mode (multimodal), or no mode at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Measures of Variability (Dispersion):**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Range:**\n",
    "   - **Description:** The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset.\n",
    "   - **Use:** It provides a simple measure of the spread of the data. However, it is sensitive to extreme values and may not capture the overall variability well.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Variance:**\n",
    "   - **Description:** Variance is the average of the squared differences between each data point and the mean.\n",
    "   - **Use:** It provides a measure of the average squared deviation from the mean. However, the units are squared, so the standard deviation is often preferred for better interpretability.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Standard Deviation:**\n",
    "   - **Description:** The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It measures the average deviation of each data point from the mean.\n",
    "   - **Use:** It is a widely used and easily interpretable measure of variability. It is appropriate for normal distributions and is sensitive to outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Interquartile Range (IQR):**\n",
    "   - **Description:** The IQR is the range between the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3).\n",
    "   - **Use:** It provides a measure of the spread of the middle 50% of the data, making it robust to outliers. It is useful for skewed distributions."
