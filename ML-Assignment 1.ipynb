    "## Question 6 \n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning, the dataset is typically divided into three subsets: training set, validation set, and test set. Here's an explanation of each:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Training Set: This is the portion of the dataset used to train the machine learning model. The model learns from the patterns in this data and adjusts its parameters accordingly. The larger and more diverse the training set, the better the model can potentially learn the underlying patterns in the data. The training set is crucial because it directly affects the performance and generalization ability of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Validation Set: After training the model on the training set, it's essential to evaluate its performance on data that it hasn't seen before. The validation set is used for this purpose. The model's performance on the validation set helps in tuning hyperparameters and assessing the model's generalization ability. By adjusting hyperparameters based on validation set performance, you can improve the model's performance without overfitting to the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Test Set: Once the model is trained and fine-tuned using the training and validation sets, its performance needs to be evaluated on completely unseen data to assess its true generalization ability. The test set is used for this purpose. It serves as an unbiased estimate of the model's performance on new, unseen data. It's crucial to keep the test set separate from the training and validation sets to avoid any data leakage and ensure an unbiased evaluation."
